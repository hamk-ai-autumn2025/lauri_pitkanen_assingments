# Snake — simple HTML5 game

This is a self-contained, dependency-free Snake game implemented as an `index.html` file.

Files
- `index.html` — the game. Open this in any modern browser to play.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser (double-click the file or drag it into a browser window).
2. Use arrow keys or WASD to move. On small screens, on-screen buttons appear.
3. Press Restart to begin a new game. Space or Enter also restarts when game over.

Notes
- High score is saved to `localStorage` in your browser.
- If you want a Python (Pygame) version, ask and I'll add it with a `requirements.txt` and runnable `snake.py`.
